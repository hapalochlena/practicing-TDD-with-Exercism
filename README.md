# Practicing TDD with Exercism

Using exercises from the [Exercism JavaScript track](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript) to learn and practice test-driven development.

Downloading the exercise files, then writing my own test file (app-2.spec.js) according to the exercise's instructions, before writing the actual app file (app-2.js) and running the tests.

During/afterwards double-checking with the test file provided by Exercism (app.spec.js) to learn how to write tests.
